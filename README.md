# LDP-PCDM

This is a walkthrough of [LDP-PCDM-F4 In Action](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA4x/LDP-PCDM-F4+In+Action)

It uses an instance of Fedora 4 built from source, but any of the prebuild war files available from the Fedora 4
[github repo](https://github.com/fcrepo4/fcrepo4/releases) should work.
